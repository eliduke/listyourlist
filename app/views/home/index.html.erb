        <h2>SIDE NOTE</h2>
        <p>Almost exactly nine years ago to the day, I bought <b>listyourlist.com</b> and then about a month later, on my sister's birthday, I launched (a crapper version of) this site! Go, Hannah! A couple years later, after getting board with how it looked, I re-built it from the ground up! There hasn't been any activity on the site in at least 8 years, but that's all about to the change because I am re-building ListYourList <b>AGAIN</b>!! I whipped together this front end to keep y'all busy while I flesh out the back end and admin. Hopefully I'll be done in a couple months, but until then feel free to poke around and find some funny stuff you talked about on the internet 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>You're welcome.</p>
